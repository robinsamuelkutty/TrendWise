The warnings and errors you're encountering seem to indicate missing configurations for your Next.js application, particularly around the NEXTAUTH_URL and NO_SECRET environment variables. You can address this by ensuring that these environment variables are set in your .env.local file.

Here’s what you should do:

Set the NEXTAUTH_URL to point to your Replit deployment URL (e.g., https://your-repl-name.repl.co).
Set a NEXTAUTH_SECRET for security purposes.
Your .env.local file should look something like this:

NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-repl-name.repl.co
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret
Make sure to replace your-repl-name with the actual name of your Replit project and your-random-secret with a secure secret value.

Once you've added those variables, save the .env file, and then try running your code again.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

I can see that your application is currently using mock/dummy data in the frontend components. To fix this and show only fetched articles from your API, I need to update the components to use the actual API endpoints instead of hardcoded data.

Let me update the main components:

components/sections/featured-articles.tsx
Now let me update the admin dashboard to also use API calls instead of mock data:

components/admin/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let me also add the necessary imports to the admin dashboard:

Finally, let me update the trending topics component to use API data as well:

components/sections/trending-topics.tsx
Now let me create a new workflow to run the development server:

Set
Development Server
to run
npm run dev
The changes I've made:

Updated FeaturedArticles component - Now fetches articles from /api/articles instead of using mock data
Updated AdminDashboard component - Fetches recent articles from the API
Updated TrendingTopics component - Fetches trending data from /api/trending
Added loading states - Shows skeleton loaders while data is being fetched
Added error handling - Gracefully handles API failures
Configured development server - Set up the Run button to start your Next.js app
Now your home page will only show real articles fetched from your API endpoints, not the dummy data. The components will display loading states while fetching and show appropriate messages if no data is available.

I can see the issue. Looking at your codebase, there are several problems preventing the trending topics and articles from working properly:

Missing OpenAI API Key: Your .env.local file has an empty OPENAI_API_KEY
API endpoints need proper implementation: The trending topics API and AI content generation services need to be connected properly
Database connection issues: The MongoDB connection might not be working correctly
Let me fix these issues:

First, let's update the trending topics API to handle cases when no topics are available:

app/api/trending/route.ts
Now let's update the trending topics component to handle the new API response format:

components/sections/trending-topics.tsx
Let's fix the AI content generation service to work properly with or without OpenAI:

lib/services/ai-content.ts
Now let's update the articles API to ensure it returns proper data:

lib/api/articles.ts
Finally, let's add a note about the OpenAI API key requirement. You need to set your OpenAI API key in the environment variables to enable AI content generation:

I notice your .env.local file has an empty OPENAI_API_KEY. To enable AI content generation, you need to:

Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
Update your .env.local file with the actual API key
For now, the application will work with mock data, but to get real AI-generated content, you'll need to add your OpenAI API key.

Looking at your code, I can see that the featured articles section is trying to fetch data from /api/articles, but there might be issues with the API or database connection. Let me help you add better error handling and debugging to show what's happening with the OpenAI API and data fetching.

First, let's update the featured articles component to show more detailed error information:

components/sections/featured-articles.tsx
Now let's add an endpoint to generate sample articles using OpenAI if none exist:

app/api/articles/generate/route.ts
Let's also update the featured articles component to include a button to generate sample articles:

Let's also add a test endpoint to check if OpenAI is working properly:

app/api/test-openai/route.ts
Now let's add a button to test OpenAI in the featured articles section:

Now the featured articles section will:

Show detailed error information when API calls fail
Display debug information to help troubleshoot issues
Test OpenAI connection to verify your API key is working
Generate sample articles using OpenAI if no articles exist
Show loading states and retry functionality
You can now:

See exactly what's happening when fetching articles fails
Test if your OpenAI API key is working properly
Generate sample articles to populate your database
Get detailed error messages instead of empty results
Try refreshing your page and use the "Test OpenAI" button to check if your API integration is working correctly!

I can see from the console logs that you're getting a 429 error from OpenAI due to quota limits. Let me help you switch to using Google's Gemini API instead. Based on your codebase, I'll need to update the AI content generation service and the test API route.

First, let's install the Gemini SDK:

Dependencies
@google/generative-ai
Now, let's update the AI content service to use Gemini instead of OpenAI:

lib/services/ai-content.ts
Now let's update the test API route to test Gemini instead of OpenAI:

app/api/test-openai/route.ts
Let's also update the featured articles component to reflect the change from OpenAI to Gemini:

components/sections/featured-articles.tsx
Now you need to update your .env.local file to include your Gemini API key instead of the OpenAI key. Make sure to add:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
And remove or comment out the OpenAI key:

I can see the issue based on the pasted information and the console logs. The problem is that you're using the wrong model name for the Gemini API. The model gemini-pro is not available in the v1beta API version, and you need to use the correct model identifier.

Let me fix the Gemini integration by updating the model name and API usage:

lib/services/ai-content.ts
app/api/test-openai/route.ts
The issue was that gemini-pro is not available in the current Gemini API. I've updated it to use gemini-1.5-flash which is the correct model name for the current Gemini API. This should resolve the 404 error you're seeing and allow your articles to be generated properly.

Try testing the Gemini connection again and generating sample articles - it should work now!

You're encountering this error:

Article validation failed: meta.openGraph: Cast to string failed for value "{ title: ..., description: ..., image: ..., type: ... }" (type Object)
🔍 Root Cause
In your MongoDB Article schema, the field meta.openGraph is defined as a String, but you are passing an object like:

meta: {
  openGraph: {
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    image: "...",
    type: "article"
  }
}
Mongoose tries to cast that entire object to a string, fails, and throws the CastError.

✅ Solution: Update the Mongoose Schema
You must define meta.openGraph as a nested object, not a plain string.

👉 Change your Mongoose schema from:
meta: {
  openGraph: String,
  ...
}
✅ To this:
meta: {
  openGraph: {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    image: String,
    type: String
  },
  // ... other meta fields if any
}
✅ Bonus Tip: If you still want openGraph as a JSON string (not recommended)
You can stringify it before saving:

meta: {
  openGraph: JSON.stringify({
    title: '...',
    description: '...',
    image: '...',
    type: 'article',
  }),
}
But again, it's better to store it as a structured object if you're working with it like that in code.

🔧 Follow-Up Fixes
✅ Update your Article schema in models/Article.ts (or wherever defined).
✅ Restart the dev server (ctrl+c → npm run dev) after changing schema.
Let me know if you'd like me to refactor your schema or article creation code — just share your schema file.

I can see the issue! The problem is that your MongoDB schema defines meta.openGraph as a String, but your code is trying to save it as an Object. This causes Mongoose to fail when trying to cast the object to a string.

Looking at the console logs, the AI is generating content where the title field contains HTML markup like '```html' and '<!DOCTYPE html>', which suggests the AI response parsing might also need some cleanup.

Let me fix the MongoDB schema to properly handle the openGraph object structure:

lib/database/mongodb.ts
Wait, I can see the schema is already correctly defined. The issue is in the article creation code. Let me check what's being passed to the createArticle function. The problem seems to be that the AI content generation is producing malformed content with HTML tags in the title.

Let me fix the article creation process to handle the openGraph object properly:

lib/api/articles.ts
Actually, the schema and createArticle code look correct. The issue is that the AI is generating content with HTML markup in the title field. Let me check and fix the AI content generation service:

lib/services/ai-content.ts

Thanks for sharing the detailed error again, Robin. You’re still hitting the same root issue: your meta.openGraph field is expecting a String, but you’re giving it an object.

✅ Here's How to Fix It
Update your Mongoose Article schema so that meta.openGraph is stored as an object, not a string.

🔧 Step-by-Step Fix
🔹 Your current schema probably looks like this:
const ArticleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  slug: String,
  content: String,
  meta: {
    openGraph: String, // ❌ This is wrong if you’re assigning an object
    twitter: String,
  },
});
✅ Change it to this:
const ArticleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  slug: String,
  content: String,
  meta: {
    openGraph: {
      title: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      type: String,
    },
    twitter: {
      title: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      card: String,
    },
  },
});
You can adjust twitter structure if it’s not needed — but this example assumes you are also using Twitter metadata in object form.

✅ Restart the Dev Server
After changing the schema:

Ctrl + C
npm run dev
⚠ Also: Check the Data You’re Passing
Make sure the generated openGraph data is like this (i.e., a plain object):

meta: {
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Sustainable Technology Innovations',
    description: 'Learn about ...',
    image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
    type: 'article',
  }
}
Don’t stringify it manually or pass it as raw HTML.

✅ Done! This will fix the CastError: Object to String issue.
Let me know if you want me to review your full schema or the createArticle() function as well.

Perfect! I can see exactly what's happening. The error is occurring because the Mongoose schema in lib/database/mongodb.ts has meta.openGraph defined as a String, but the createArticle function is trying to save an object to that field.

Looking at the current schema, I can see it already has the correct structure with openGraph as an object, but there might be a caching issue or the schema needs to be properly applied.

Let me check the schema structure and ensure it's correctly defined:

lib/database/mongodb.ts
The schema looks correct, but let me also ensure that Mongoose properly recognizes the schema by clearing any cached models:

Now restart your development server to ensure the schema changes take effect:

pkill -f "npm run dev" && npm run dev
This should resolve the validation error. The issue was likely that Mongoose had cached the old model definition. By explicitly clearing the cached model and recreating it, the new schema structure with openGraph as an object should now work properly.

Try generating articles again after the server restarts - they should now save successfully to the database!

You're getting this error because in your Mongoose schema, the field meta.openGraph is defined as a string, but your code is passing an object to it.

✅ Problem in Simple Terms
meta.openGraph: {
  title: '...',
  description: '...',
  image: '...',
  type: 'article'
}
This object is being passed to a schema expecting a string, so Mongoose throws a CastError.

✅ How to Fix It
You have two options:

✅ Option 1: Update the Mongoose Schema
If you want to store the full Open Graph object (which is recommended), update your Mongoose schema to accept an object instead of a string:

// Example schema fix in Mongoose
const articleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // ... other fields
  meta: {
    openGraph: {
      title: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      type: String
    },
    // optionally add twitter, etc.
  }
});
This allows you to store structured data for openGraph.

✅ Option 2: Convert Object to JSON String (Not Recommended Unless Required)
If your schema must store meta.openGraph as a string, convert the object to a string before saving:

meta: {
  openGraph: JSON.stringify({
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    image: "...",
    type: "article"
  })
}
But this means you’ll have to manually JSON.parse() it whenever you need to use the data later.

✅ Recommended Fix
Update the schema to accept an object structure — that is cleaner, easier to manage, and future-proof:

// lib/models/Article.ts or wherever your schema is
meta: {
  openGraph: {
    title: { type: String },
    description: { type: String },
    image: { type: String },
    type: { type: String }
  }
}
Let me know if you want help editing the exact schema file.

I can see the exact issue! The problem is that Mongoose is still caching the old schema definition where meta.openGraph was expected to be a String. Even though we updated the schema to accept an object structure, Mongoose hasn't fully recognized the change.

Looking at the logs, the error shows that Mongoose is trying to cast the object to a string, which means it's still using the old schema definition.

Let me fix this by ensuring the schema is properly defined and by forcing a complete schema refresh:

lib/database/mongodb.ts
Force complete schema refresh and ensure openGraph is properly defined as object
Now let's restart the development server to ensure the schema changes take effect:

pkill -f "npm run dev"
npm run dev
The key changes I made:

Forced complete model clearing: Added Object.keys(mongoose.models).forEach(key => { delete mongoose.models[key]; }); to ensure all cached models are completely cleared
Explicitly defined all schema types: Made sure every field has explicit { type: String } definitions instead of just String
Proper openGraph structure: Defined meta.openGraph as a nested object with proper field types
This should resolve the casting error. The schema now properly expects meta.openGraph to be an object with title, description, image, type, and url fields, which matches exactly what your createArticle function is trying to save.

After the server restarts, try generating articles again - they should save successfully to the database!

I can see you want to implement search functionality that uses Gemini AI to show relevant articles as search results. Looking at your current setup, I can see that:

You already have a search bar component (components/articles/search-bar.tsx)
You have Gemini AI integration working (based on the logs showing successful Gemini responses)
You have article generation and fetching working
Let me implement the search functionality that will use Gemini AI to find and generate relevant content when users search.

First, let's create a new API endpoint for AI-powered search:

app/api/search/route.ts
Now let's create a dedicated search results page:

app/search/page.tsx
Now let's update the search bar component to redirect to the new search page:

components/articles/search-bar.tsx
Let's also add a search link to the header navigation:

components/layout/header.tsx
Finally, let's enhance the AI content generation to better handle search queries by updating the Gemini prompt:

lib/services/ai-content.ts
Now your search functionality will work as follows:

Search Bar: Users can search from any page, and it will redirect to the dedicated search page
AI-Enhanced Search: When users search for content, the system will:
First look for existing articles matching the search query
If there aren't enough existing results, it will use Gemini AI to generate a fresh, relevant article based on the search query
Display both existing and AI-generated content with clear labels
Search Results Page: Shows search results with special badges for AI-generated content
Smart Content Generation: The AI prompt is optimized to create content that directly addresses the user's search intent
Users can now search for any topic (like "quantum computing", "sustainable energy", "remote work trends", etc.) and get relevant articles, with new content being generated on-demand using Gemini AI when needed!

I can see you want to enhance the search functionality to use Gemini API to generate relevant articles when users search for content. Looking at your existing code, you already have this partially implemented in app/api/search/route.ts, but it's missing the complete implementation.

Let me create the missing search API route and enhance the search functionality:

app/api/search/route.ts
Create search API that uses Gemini to generate articles for search queries
Now let me create the search results page to display the search results properly:

app/search/page.tsx
Create search results page that displays AI-generated articles
Now let me enhance the search bar component to make it work better with the new search functionality:

components/articles/search-bar.tsx
Enhance search bar with better UX and AI search indication
Now let me add a search link to the main header navigation so users can easily access the search functionality:

components/layout/header.tsx
Add search link to header navigation
Perfect! I've implemented a comprehensive search functionality that uses the Gemini API to generate articles when users search for content. Here's what I've added:

Key Features:
Smart Search API (/api/search/route.ts):

First searches existing articles in the database
If fewer than 3 results found, uses Gemini AI to generate a new article based on the search query
Returns both existing and AI-generated content
Enhanced Search Results Page (/app/search/page.tsx):

Clean, modern UI showing search results
Special badges for AI-generated content
Loading states while AI generates content
Error handling with retry options
Improved Search Bar (components/articles/search-bar.tsx):

Updated placeholder text mentioning AI generation
Visual indicator that search is powered by Gemini AI
Better UX with clear search and navigation
Header Navigation Update:

Added "Search" link to the main navigation
How It Works:
User searches for any topic (e.g., "machine learning", "sustainable energy", etc.)
System first checks existing articles in the database
If insufficient results (less than 3 articles), Gemini AI generates a comprehensive article about the search topic
Results displayed with clear indicators showing which content is AI-generated
New articles saved to database for future searches
Benefits:
Always relevant results: Even for obscure topics, users get comprehensive articles
Fresh content: AI generates new perspectives on trending topics
Better SEO: More content indexed for search engines
Enhanced user experience: No empty search results
The search functionality now intelligently combines existing content with AI-generated articles, ensuring users always find valuable, relevant information for their queries!

Robin, you're getting this error because you defined the createComment function twice in the same file: lib/api/comments.ts.

🧨 Error:
the name `createComment` is defined multiple times
✅ Solution: Remove or Rename One of Them
In your file lib/api/comments.ts, you have:

1️⃣ MOCK Version (Line ~47):
export async function createComment(data: CreateCommentData): Promise<Comment> {
  // mock implementation using local array
}
2️⃣ REAL MONGODB Version (Line ~165):
export async function createComment(commentData: {
  articleId: string;
  author: { name: string; email: string; avatar?: string };
  content: string;
}): Promise<Comment> {
  // real implementation using MongoDB
}
🔧 Fix Options:
✅ Option 1: Delete the mock one if you're using MongoDB
// ❌ DELETE THIS if you're using real DB
// export async function createComment(data: CreateCommentData): Promise<Comment> {
//   ...
// }
✅ Option 2: Rename mock version (for testing purposes only)
// ✅ Rename if you want to keep both
export async function createMockComment(data: CreateCommentData): Promise<Comment> {
  ...
}
🧹 Bonus: Clean your import statements
Also check your imports at the top. If you use:

import { createComment } from '@/lib/api/comments'
Make sure it refers to only one function, or it will confuse the runtime and trigger the duplicate error again.

I'll help you implement authentication for the comment system so only logged-in users can post comments. Let me update the comment component to include authentication checks.

components/article/article-comments.tsx
Now I need to update the main layout to include the session provider so authentication works throughout the app:

app/layout.tsx
Now let me add authentication checks to the comments API to ensure only authenticated users can post:

app/api/comments/route.ts
Now let me update the header to show sign in/out buttons:

components/layout/header.tsx
Perfect! I've implemented authentication for the comment system. Here's what I added:

Key Changes:
1. Comment Component (components/article/article-comments.tsx)
Added useSession hook to check authentication status
Replaced name/email inputs with authenticated user info
Shows user avatar and name when logged in
Displays sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users
Prevents comment submission without authentication
2. Comments API (app/api/comments/route.ts)
Added server-side authentication check using getServerSession
Returns 401 error for unauthenticated requests
Verifies author email matches authenticated user
Prevents unauthorized comment creation
3. Layout (app/layout.tsx)
Added SessionProvider to enable authentication throughout the app
4. Header (components/layout/header.tsx)
Added authentication buttons (Sign In/Sign Out)
Shows user avatar and dropdown when authenticated
Displays loading state during session check
Features:
✅ Only authenticated users can post comments
✅ User authentication is verified on both client and server
✅ Comments show authenticated user's name and avatar
✅ Clear sign-in prompts for unauthenticated users
✅ Secure API endpoints with session validation

Now only logged-in users can post comments, and the system uses their authenticated profile information automatically!

I can see the issue! The error is occurring because there are multiple problems with the authentication setup:

Import/Export mismatch: The SessionProvider is not being exported correctly from the session provider file
Duplicate function definition: There's still a duplicate createComment function in the comments file
Missing import: The header component is missing the usePathname import
Let me fix these issues:

components/auth/session-provider.tsx
components/layout/header.tsx
lib/api/comments.ts
